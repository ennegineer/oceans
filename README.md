# Human Impact on Oceans

In this project we have analyzed and compared data from multiple sources to look at the human impact on our oceans. This includes fishing, which has a direct impact on fish populations and pollution in our oceans, as well as indirect action such as agriculture and industrialization which has lead to eutrophication of our world's waterways and coastal regions, as well as marine debris.

## Caveat

This project is not yet hosted in the cloud. Due to space limitations, there is a folder in 'static' called 'data' that has not been uploaded to this repository. 

To run this project, open the repository locally and add the data folder into your local static folder by downloading it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Jxd06xQMhpeNXNyk3DhE1ZW3o8id2M7m?usp=sharing) - then run app.py to see the flask application. 

Note that the Data page containing the APIs currently only works via a locally hosted MongoDB database.
